# Problem Statement :
This semester we had a long weekend when me and my friends tried to plan a trip to Coimbatore. Unfortunately the plan was all over the place, obviously, no proper travel arrangements were made, no fixed hotel bookings, much more. 🥲🫥

We ended up playing games at our hostel during the long weekend. 😂

Motivated by this situation and not miss out on any other trips I am introducing Raahi to solve this by providing a simple, unified travel-planning experience where users can effortlessly create, organize, and manage end-to-end trip itineraries in one place.
